## 📁 Repository Contents

This repo contains multiple standalone Node.js apps organized by folder. Here's a breakdown of what each directory offers:

### 🔹 1. **Student-Application**
- A complete CRUD application for managing students.
- Built with Express.js, EJS templates, and in-memory data handling.
- Demonstrates full MVC pattern and RESTful routes.

### 🔹 2. **REST_API**
- Basic REST API with structured routing using Express.js.
- Includes endpoints to get, post, update, and delete records.
- Good for learning how to build scalable REST services.

### 🔹 3. **Short-URL-Generator**
- A mini project to shorten long URLs and redirect users.
- Uses Express and a key-based ID system.
- Stores short URL mappings in memory (or file if extended).

### 🔹 4. **Image_Upload_App**
- Demonstrates image upload functionality using `multer`.
- Form-based image upload and display logic.
- Useful for learning file handling and form submission in Node.js.

### 🔹 5. **SocketIO-App**
- Real-time messaging using WebSockets via `socket.io`.
- Broadcasts messages across connected clients.
- Great starting point for building chat apps or live features.

### 🔹 6. **MVC_App**
- Follows a clean MVC folder structure.
- Uses Express and EJS for full-stack rendering.
- Demonstrates separation of concerns in app architecture.

### 🔹 7. **HTTP-Server**
- A low-level Node.js project using core `http` module.
- Shows how to handle routes manually without frameworks.
- Good for understanding what happens under the hood.

### 🔹 8. **Cluster_Server**
